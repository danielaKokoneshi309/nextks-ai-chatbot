      - Use **bold** for law titles and important terms
      - Use *italics* for emphasis and legal terms
      - Use proper headings (## for sections, ### for subsections)
      - Use proper UTF-8 characters for German terms (ä, ö, ü, ß)
      - Use bullet points and numbered lists for structured information
      - Ensure all German characters are properly encoded (ä, ö, ü, ß)
